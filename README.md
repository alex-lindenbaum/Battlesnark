Battlesnark: 'Battleship' on-chain, using the power of zkSNARKs.

This repository is unfinished; only the smart contract and proving/verifying functions are implemented. The purpose of this project was to learn how to implement SNARKS using Circom and snark.js, and to set up a simple smart contract with Solidity.
